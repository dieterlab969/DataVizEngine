# Wikipedia Data Visualization - Project Implementation Plan
**Timeline: 16 hours (2 days) | Start Date: October 15, 2025**

## Project Overview
Implementation of a web application that extracts numeric data from Wikipedia tables and generates visualizations using Python/Seaborn.

## Milestones & Tasks

### Day 1 

#### 1. Environment Setup & Project Initialization
- Configurate Laravel project for API development with required dependencies
- Set up React development environment with necessary packages
- Set up Python environment with Seaborn/Matplotlib
- Create project repository with separate frontend and backend directories
- Configure development environment variables and CORS settings

#### 2. Backend: Laravel API Development
- Implement Wikipedia page fetching using Guzzle
- Develop HTML parsing logic with DomCrawler
- Create algorithm to identify and extract numeric columns 
- Build RESTful API endpoints for data extraction
- Implement error handling and API response formatting
- Configure API documentation with Swagger

#### 3. Frontend: React Base Implementation
- Set up React project structure with component-based architecture 
- Create responsive UI layout with form for Wikipedia URL input
- Implement form validation for Wikipedia URLs
- Set up state management and API service integration
- Create basic UI components (navbar, form, containers)

### Day 2 

#### 4. Frontend: Data Display & Interaction
- Implement table components to display extracted data
- Create column selection interface for numeric fields
- Build visualization type selector (bar, chart, etc.)
- Add loading states and error handling for API interactions
- Implement responsive design for all screen sizes

#### 5. Python Visualization Implementation
- Create Python script to accept data input
- Implement Seaborn visualization logic for multiple chart types
- Configure graph styling and formatting
- Build image export functionality
- Add parameter handling for customization

#### 6. Integration & Testing
- Connect React frontend with Laravel API endpoints
- Implement Laravel-Python communication layer
- Set up data passing mechanism between systems
- Create image storage and retrieval system
- Perform end-to-end testing of the complete workflow
- Implement any final adjustments based on testing results

## Success Criteria
- System correctly extracts numeric data from Wikipedia tables
- Visualization clearly represents the extracted data
- Web interface is intuitive and provides feedback
- Solution handles errors gracefully
- Code is well-structured and documented

## Risk Mitigation
- **Wikipedia Structure Changes**: Use robust parsing with fallback options
- **Complex Tables**: Implement progressive detection algorithms
- **Integration Issues**: Create clear interfaces between components
- **Time Constraints**: Focus on core functionality first, then enhance

## Resources Required
- Laravel development environment
- Python 3.8+ with Seaborn/Matplotlib
- Code repository (GitHub/GitLab)
- Development workstation
